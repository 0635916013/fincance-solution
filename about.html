<br><u>What can I use my personal loan for?</u><br>
<br>
A DirectAxis personal loan is paid directly into your bank account and the money can be used for any needs you may have. Whether you’re looking to do home renovations, upgrade your electronics or take a break overseas, a personal loan offers a flexible solution. There are many ways you can use your money.
<br>
<br>
<u>What do you get with a DirectAxis Personal Loan?</u><br>
<br>
When you take out a loan with DirectAxis you’ll deal with an authorised Financial Services Provider, with many years of financial services experience in South Africa. We support responsible lending, so if your application is approved, you’ll only be approved for an amount that you can afford comfortably. We’ll do our utmost to give you the best offer that we possibly can.
<br>
Because DirectAxis Personal Loans are unsecured this means that we won’t ask you to use your car, home or any other asset as collateral. To apply for a loan is quick and you can also use your loan for anything you want
<br>
For your security and peace of mind, all our loans are subject to the National Credit Act of 2005. Keep in mind, we consider all loan applications and every application is subject to credit approval.
<br>
Your loan will include a Personal Protection Plan, which settles your outstanding balance in the event of your death or permanent disability. This plan also offers some cover for temporary disability and retrenchment – and the level of your cover will be based on your risk profile. You can substitute the Personal Protection Plan with a policy of your choice, provided the cover offered is equivalent.
<br>
DirectAxis administers loans for FirstRand Bank Limited, an authorised Financial Services and Credit Provider, and has been providing loans to South Africans for over 20 years.
<br>
Loan repayment terms range from a minimum of 24 to a maximum of 72 months. The maximum interest rate with regards to a DirectAxis Personal Loan is 27.25% per annum (compounded monthly). Your rate and initiation fee will be determined according to your personal risk profile. An illustrative example of a R50 000 loan at an interest rate of 27.25% per annum plus a once-off initiation fee of R1 207.50 (added to the loan amount in this example) and a monthly admin fee of R69.00, over 72 months would have a total cost of R 116 623.20.<br></h2>
